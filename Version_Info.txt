v0 Continuation: This is a continuation of respo Ai_Development_0, will be studying A.i a bit more in-depth
                        As of now just created the respo, with the necassary files to start the program. made a
                        version_info.txt, readme, and chap1. will be reading pythonmachinelearning -
                        The Python Machine Learning Ecosystem Chap1 at the moment.

v1 Respo Fixed: Fixed couple of issues with v0, now the README.md can be seen & Version_Info.txt on the 1st page
                once a user clicks on the respo. Also modified the venv/changed location of the files to second folder.
                Instead of have to click on 3 folders to see a program.

v2 PyCharm & Jupyter Notebook: Just got started on Jupyter for learning a bit more about pandas/aquiring data
                                from iris datasets, will be making a new folder to hold jupyter programs to seperate it
                                from pycharm files to help organize a bit. As of now I'm going deep in A.I/machine development
                                this is going to be a blast!

v3 DataFrame Pandas: testing some notes for using pandas and df for gathering data @ file dataset_for_jupyter.ipnb

v4 Jupyter Theme Changed & Notes added: Link to help with changing Jupyter theme to 'dark mode'
                                            link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxrDf6Pp6M

                                            github link for shortcut for adding new line on jupyter:
                                            https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3918

                                            df.iloc[:3,:2]
                                            .iloc notation and the Python list slicing syntax,
                                             we were able to select a slice of this DataFrame.

                                             Added a new file called Demo of Jupyter, just a mini file testing Jupyter
                                             Shift-Enter to auto start the program,
                                             esc-b to make a new line

--v5 Testing .iloc & loc iterators: -using list iterator to select just the width feature columns:
                                           df.loc[:3, [x for x in df.columns if 'width' in x]]
                                           'reate a list that is a subset of all columns. df.columns returns a list
                                           of all columns, and our iteration uses a conditional statement to
                                           select only those with width in the title'

                                           df.iloc[:4,:2] to select sepal length & sepal width

                                           df.iloc[:1,:5] selecting -> 	sepal length (cm)	sepal width (cm)
                                           petal length (cm)	petal width (cm) & 	species

                                           file changes are @ dataset_for_jupyter.ipynb
