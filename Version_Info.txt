v0 Continuation: This is a continuation of respo Ai_Development_0, will be studying A.i a bit more in-depth
                        As of now just created the respo, with the necassary files to start the program. made a
                        version_info.txt, readme, and chap1. will be reading pythonmachinelearning -
                        The Python Machine Learning Ecosystem Chap1 at the moment.

v1 Respo Fixed: Fixed couple of issues with v0, now the README.md can be seen & Version_Info.txt on the 1st page
                once a user clicks on the respo. Also modified the venv/changed location of the files to second folder.
                Instead of have to click on 3 folders to see a program.

--v2 PyCharm & Jupyter Notebook: Just got started on Jupyter for learning a bit more about pandas/aquiring data
                                from iris datasets, will be making a new folder to hold jupyter programs to seperate it
                                from pycharm files to help organize a bit. As of now I'm going deep in A.I/machine development
                                this is going to be a blast!
